# DB
Do as me
<<wake up at 9 am
  <<realize that db isn't ok
    <<finish db at 15:30
      *eat*
      <<realize that making repositories isn't easy first time
       *find out that all i needed all this time is to install GitHub CLI*
        <<finish making repository at 01:00
          <<end(2:10)
